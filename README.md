# Tennis-game

This is a simple 2D Ping pong game using JavaScript.
Where we will have a court, two paddles (one is for system and one is for you to play) and there will be a ball.
So you can play it as tennis, you ahve to hit the ball with paddle. The person who wins the round will get a point.
I have set a winning tally, Whoever reaches the tally will win the match.
